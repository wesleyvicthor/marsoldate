Facing Problems and Suggested solutions for 2120 Mars Mission 
=================


Oxygen Supply
=====
as Earth with a solid source of Oxygen, this supplier could be a strong candidate to provide Mars
the first initial necessary Oxygen. Through boxed sources of oxygen and artificial lab made photosynthesis.
An in loop process containerization.
This could be a quickly solution until we are able to create Oxygen in other forms. as the ongoing Nasa initiative
MOXIE.The way MOXIE works is relatively straightforward: It will take the abundant carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, which is made of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms, and isolate one of the oxygen atoms. They will then combine the oxygen atoms together to make O2

Marketing
=====
In a new land everything already existent could magically be explored. Not only, the change to create a new system of marketing
or advertising information is easily to be explored. The classical forms of visual marketing and communicative could firstly be 
explored, as long with the usual and famous nowadays screens ability to transmit emotions through colors, sounds and deep immersive visuals.
Exploring another planet superficies is a huge whiteboard for unlimited creativity when targeting a new form of life.
The initial aspects of marketing on earth to promote Mars could be a bit not motivated tho, in the end, attractiveness to a place where there
are not much people on it are quite low. but with time, targeting and conversion rate can exponential increase.

Vegetables
=====
Vegetables is an easy target at the moment as it has been proven that mostly of a well know ones can be grown in the red planet.
different forms of growing and exporting could also be explored. The usual and initial tanks with proper cultivation would be the best
initial fit for such achievement.

Accounting
====
New planet, new Earth new forms of think and develop. this would require a much deeper understanding of the life time of a transaction and data storage. We are expanding in land so in technology, but also in amount of transactions, everything is exponentially growing and that would allow
at the first moment a horizontal scaling of resources. Visualization and search would also need to improve as long as data formats of storage and data structures. Management Accounting Report Systems is proportionally direct related and has everything to do with Mars.
